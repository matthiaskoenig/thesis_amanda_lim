The radioactivity  was eliminated mainly in the urine, while no sigificant biliary excretion was  observed. Chromatographic analysis of the urinary radioactivity demonstrated that  greater than 95\% of the absorbed or injected 14C-hct was excreted unchanged. The  radioactivity in plasma during the first 10 hr after oral administration declined  with a fast phase but the levels of label thereafter suggested a slow phase. The  existence of such a phase was verified in 1 subject given 75 mg hct orally. His  plasma levels of hct (determined with gas-liquid chromatography) declined  according to a 2-compartment model, the half-lives of the alpha-and beta-phases  being 1.7 and 13.1 hr, respectively. Hct accumulated in the blood cells and the  ratio between the radioactivity in cells and that in plasma averaged 3.5. The  fate of a single dose of 14C-hct in 2 hypertensive patients treated with the drug  chronically was similar to that in the healthy subjects. A third patient, who had  slightly elevated serum creatinine, eliminated hct more slowly than the others.  Like the healthy subjects, the patients eliminated hct to greater than 95\% in  unchanged form.},

  abstract = {Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a thiazide diuretic used in adults and children for the treatment of hypertension and edema. The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of  HCTZ in children are not well characterized, particularly among children with  obesity who frequently suffer from hypertension and may, therefore, benefit from  HCTZ therapy. HCTZ is excreted in the kidney via organic anion transporters 1 and  3 (OAT1 and OAT3). The ontogeny of OAT1 and OAT3 remain unknown, but HCTZ  clearance may serve as a surrogate marker of OAT1 and OAT3 maturation. Population  PK modeling was performed in NONMEM, and the model was leveraged to conduct  dose-exposure simulations. This study examined 83 plasma samples from 49  participants (69\% male) taking enteral HCTZ. The median (range) postnatal age was  6.7 years (0.03-19.5 years), and 17 (34\%) participants were obese or morbidly  obese. The median (range) dose of HCTZ was 0.654 mg/kg (0.11-1.8 kg) and the  median number of doses recorded per participant was 5 (1-8). HCTZ PK was well  characterized by a 1-compartment PK model. Body weight and a maturation model  based on postmenstrual age were significant covariates for apparent clearance,  but the presence of obesity was not. Dosing simulations were performed with a  standardized 1mg/kg. Simulated exposure (area under the curve and maximum HCTZ  concentrations) decreased with age and was likely due to older children receiving  the maximum absolute doses of HCTZ. Further studies with more patients in each  age group are required to confirm these PK findings of HCTZ in the children.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) also have hypertension, which is commonly treated with thiazide diuretics, including  hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Canagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2  inhibitor developed for the treatment of T2DM, lowers plasma glucose by  inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, thereby increasing urinary glucose  excretion and mild osmotic diuresis. Because patients with T2DM are likely to  receive concurrent canagliflozin and HCTZ, potential interactions were evaluated.  OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effects of HCTZ on the pharmacokinetic and  pharmacodynamic properties and tolerability of canagliflozin in healthy  participants. METHODS: This Phase I, single-center, open-label, fixed-sequence,  2-period study was conducted in healthy participants. During period 1,  participants received canagliflozin 300 mg once daily for 7 days, followed by a  14-day washout period. During period 2, participants received HCTZ 25 mg once  daily for 28 days, followed by canagliflozin 300 mg + HCTZ 25 mg once daily for 7  days. Blood samples were taken before and several times after administration on  day 7 of period 1 and on days 28 and 35 of period 2 for canagliflozin and HCTZ  pharmacokinetic analyses using LC-MS/MS. Blood and urine samples were collected  for up to 24 hours after canagliflozin administration on day 1 of period 1 and  day 35 of period 2 for pharmacodynamic glucose assessment. Tolerability was also  evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty participants were enrolled (16 men, 14 women; all  white; mean age, 43.7 years). Canagliflozin AUC during a dosing interval (T) at  steady state (AUC{$\tau$},ss) and Cmax at steady state (Cmax,ss) were increased when  canagliflozin was coadministered with HCTZ, with geometric mean ratios (90\% CI)  of 1.12 (1.08-1.17) and 1.15 (1.06-1.25), respectively. AUC{$\tau$},ss and Cmax,ss for  HCTZ were similar with and without canagliflozin coadministration. The 24-hour  mean renal threshold for glucose and mean plasma glucose were comparable for  canagliflozin alone and coadministered with HCTZ. The change in 24-hour urine  volume from baseline was -0.1 L with canagliflozin alone and 0.4 L with HCTZ  alone and with canagliflozin + HCTZ. The overall incidence of adverse events  (AEs) was higher with canagliflozin + HCTZ (69\%) than with canagliflozin (47\%) or  HCTZ (50\%) alone; most AEs were of mild severity. Overall, minimal changes in  serum electrolytes (eg, sodium, potassium) were observed after coadministration  of canagliflozin + HCTZ compared with individual treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Adding  canagliflozin treatment to healthy participants on HCTZ treatment had no notable  pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic effects; canagliflozin coadministered with  HCTZ was generally well tolerated, with no unexpected tolerability concerns.

Simultaneously, the effects of the three treatments on plasma  converting enzyme activity (PCEA) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were measured.  Elimination half-lives of total captopril after acute (7.8 +/- 2.3 h) or chronic  (7.0 +/- 0.5 h) captopril dosing were similar to those of HCTZ after acute (6.5  +/- 1.0 h) or chronic (8.0 +/- 2.5 h) HCTZ dosing. Elimination half-life of free  unchanged captopril was 0.81 +/- 0.09 h after acute and 0.96 +/- 0.03 h after  chronic captopril dosing. Addition of HCTZ to captopril induced no major change  in free and total captopril pharmacokinetic parameters, in PCEA inhibition and in  PRA increase (as they were determined after captopril alone) on acute as well as  on chronic treatment. Addition of captopril to HCTZ induced no major change in  HCTZ pharmacokinetic parameters and in PRA increase compared with those  determined after HCTZ alone. Chronic treatment with captopril + HCTZ resulted,  like chronic captopril treatment, in no accumulation of captopril, in no  significant modification of free and total captopril pharmacokinetic parameters  and of PCEA inhibition (as determined after acute administration) but led to a  significant enhancement of the acutely induced increase in PRA. Chronic treatment  with captopril + HCTZ resulted, like chronic HCTZ treatment, in no accumulation  of HCTZ, in no significant modification of HCTZ pharmacokinetic parameters (as  determined after acute administration) but also led to a significant enhancement  of the acutely induced increase in PRA. Thus, the longer duration of the  antihypertensive action of captopril + HCTZ as compared to that of captopril  cannot be ascribed to a pharmacokinetic or biological interaction between  captopril and HCTZ.},

PK-DB provides curated information on (i) characteristics of studied patient cohorts and subjects (e.g. age, bodyweight, smoking status, genetic variants); (ii) applied interventions (e.g. dosing, substance, route of application); (iii) pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g. clearance, half-life, area under the curve)~and (iv) measured pharmacokinetic time-courses. Key features are the representation of experimental errors, the normalization of measurement units, annotation of information to biological ontologies, calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters from concentration-time profiles, a workflow for collaborative data curation, strong validation rules on the data, computational access via a REST API as well as human access via a web interface. PK-DB enables meta-analysis based on data from multiple studies and data integration with computational models. A special focus lies on meta-data relevant for individualized and stratified computational modeling with methods like physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK), pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD), or population pharmacokinetic (pop PK) modeling.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Empagliflozin is a potent, selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thiazide or  loop diuretics are commonly prescribed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  This study investigated potential pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between  empagliflozin and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or torasemide (TOR). METHODS: This  was an open-label, crossover study. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were  randomized to receive empagliflozin 25 mg once daily for 5 days and either HCTZ  25 mg once daily for 4 days followed by HCTZ 25 mg once daily plus empagliflozin  25 mg once daily for 5 days or TOR 5 mg once daily for 4 days followed by TOR 5  mg once daily plus empagliflozin once daily for 5 days in 1 of 4 sequences, with  at least a 7-day washout period between treatments. Pharmacokinetic parameters of  empagliflozin, HCTZ, and TOR were assessed and standard bioequivalence criteria  (80\%-125\%) were applied. Tolerability assessments included the frequency of  adverse events and an investigator assessment of global tolerability. FINDINGS:  Mean (SD) age of the 22 patients treated was 54.0 (8.1) years and body mass index  was 27.1 (3.7) kg/m(2). Coadministration of empagliflozin with HCTZ or TOR had no  effect on exposure to empagliflozin, HCTZ, or TOR. Geometric mean ratios (90\%  CIs) for empagliflozin AUC over a uniform dosing interval and Cmax at steady  state were 107.1\% (90\% CI, 97.1-118.1) and 102.8\% (90\% CI, 88.6-119.3),  respectively, when coadministered with HCTZ versus administration alone, and  107.8\% (90\% CI, 100.1-116.1) and 107.5\% (90\% CI, 97.9-118.0), respectively, when  coadministered with TOR versus administration alone. For HCTZ, the geometric mean  ratios for AUC over a uniform dosing interval and Cmax at steady state were 96.3\%  (90\% CI, 89.1-104.0) and 101.8\% (90\% CI, 88.6-116.9), respectively, and for TOR  were 101.4\% (90\% CI, 99.1-103.9) and 104.4\% (90\% CI, 93.8-116.3), respectively,  for combined treatment versus administration alone. The pharmacokinetic profiles  of empagliflozin, HCTZ, and TOR were similar after administration alone and in  combination. Global tolerability was good for all patients after each treatment,  and no severe or serious adverse events were reported. IMPLICATIONS: No  pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction was observed between empagliflozin and HCTZ  or TOR. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01276288.},

We have compared the pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat  (the active metabolite of enalapril) and HCT in a four-way comparison of a  combination tablet of enalapril (10 mg)/HCT (25 mg) with a single dose of an  enalapril tablet (10 mg), a single dose of a HCT tablet (25 mg) and simultaneous  administration of separate tablets of enalapril (10 mg) and HCT (25 mg) in  normotensive volunteers (n = 12, 21-26 years). Each subject received all four  treatments and the study was conducted as a randomized, latin square, open design  with at least 1 week washout between studies. Overall, HCT was bioequivalent  under all conditions and enalaprilat was bioequivalent when given in combination  with HCT either as one tablet or as two separate tablets. However, when given  with HCT, the mean AUC and Cmax of enalaprilat were reduced up to 20 per cent  compared with enalapril administered alone. This is unlikely to be of clinical  significance as the differences did not reach statistical significance and the  total enalaprilat excreted in the urine over 96 h was similar after all  treatments.},

A single 8 gm dose of cholestyramine 2 hours before  or after HCTZ, 75 mg po, significantly decreased the amount of HCTZ excreted  unchanged in the urine over 24 hours (Ae(0-24)) by 65\% (P less than 0.01) and 26\%  (P less than 0.05), respectively, in four subjects. Six subjects randomly  received three different schedules: control, single dose of cholestyramine 4  hours after HCTZ, and multiple doses of cholestyramine (-24, -12, and +4 hours)  after HCTZ. There were no significant differences in HCTZ kinetics between the  control group and the subjects who received a single dose of cholestyramine.  Multiple doses of cholestyramine significantly altered HCTZ kinetics, including  reductions in Ae(0-24) by 35\% (P less than 0.02), AUC(0-infinity) by 32\% (P less  than 0.01), and Cmax by 31\% (P less than 0.01).

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), which is used to treat hypertension and edematous  conditions, is coadministered with many antihypertensive agents. METHODS: An  open-label, randomized, multiple-dosing, 2-arm, 1-sequence, 2-period study was  conducted to assess the effects of fimasartan (240 mg) on HCTZ (25 mg) or vice  versa in 18 and 14 healthy male volunteers, respectively. During each drug  administration period, drugs were given once daily for 7 days, with a 7-day  washout period between the 2 administration periods. RESULTS: The respective  geometric mean ratios of fimasartan for AUC {$\tau$},ss and C max,ss with HCTZ were 1.30  [90\% confidence interval (CI), 0.84-2.01] and 1.17 (90\% CI, 0.93-1.47) compared  with fimasartan alone. The respective geometric mean ratios of HCTZ for AUC {$\tau$},ss  and C max,ss with fimasartan were 0.94 (90\% CI, 0.84-1.04) and 0.88 (90\% CI,  0.80-0.97) compared with HCTZ alone. Plasma renin activity indicated no  significant differences between fimasartan monotherapy and coadministered  treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Fimasartan administered alone or in combination with HCTZ  was well tolerated at the described dosages. Coadministration of fimasartan  increased the urinary excretion of HCTZ and urine volume, but these observations  are unlikely to have any clinical relevance.},

  abstract = {Accurate evaluation of liver function is a central task in hepatology. Dynamic liver function tests (DLFT) based on the time-dependent elimination of a test substance provide an important tool for such a functional assessment. These tests are used in the diagnosis and monitoring of liver disease as well as in the planning of hepatobiliary surgery. A key challenge in the evaluation of liver function with DLFTs is the large inter-individual variability. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a widely applied test compound used for the evaluation of liver function. After an intravenous administration, pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters are calculated from the plasma disappearance curve of ICG which provide an estimate of liver function. The hepatic elimination of ICG is affected by physiological factors such as hepatic blood flow or binding of ICG to plasma proteins, anthropometric factors such as body weight, age, and sex, or the protein amount of the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3) mediating the hepatic uptake of ICG. Being able to account for and better understand these various sources of inter-individual variability would allow to improve the power of ICG based DLFTs and move toward an individualized evaluation of liver function. Within this work we systematically analyzed the effect of various factors on ICG elimination by the means of computational modeling. For the analysis, a recently developed and validated physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) model of ICG distribution and hepatic elimination was utilized. Key results are (i) a systematic analysis of the variability in ICG elimination due to hepatic blood flow, cardiac output, OATP1B3 abundance, liver volume, body weight and plasma bilirubin level; (ii) the evaluation of the inter-individual variability in ICG elimination via a large               in silico               cohort of               n               = 100,000 subjects based on the NHANES cohort with special focus on stratification by age, sex, and body weight; (iii) the evaluation of the effect of various degrees of cirrhosis on variability in ICG elimination. The presented results are an important step toward individualizing liver function tests by elucidating the effects of confounding physiological and anthropometric parameters in the evaluation of liver function via ICG.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of hepatic function and functional capacity of the liver are essential tasks in hepatology as well as in hepatobiliary surgery. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a widely applied test compound that is used in clinical routine to evaluate hepatic function. Important questions for the functional evaluation with ICG in the context of hepatectomy are how liver disease such as cirrhosis alters ICG elimination, and if postoperative survival can be predicted from preoperative ICG measurements. Within this work a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of ICG was developed and applied to the prediction of the effects of a liver resection under various degrees of cirrhosis. For the parametrization of the computational model and validation of model predictions a database of ICG pharmacokinetic data was established. The model was applied (i) to study the effect of liver cirrhosis and liver resection on ICG pharmacokinetics; and (ii) to evaluate the model-based prediction of postoperative ICG-R15 (retention ratio 15 min after administration) as a measure for postoperative outcome. Key results are the accurate prediction of changes in ICG pharmacokinetics caused by liver cirrhosis and postoperative changes of ICG-elimination after liver resection, as validated with a wide range of data sets. Based on the PBPK model, individual survival after liver resection could be classified, demonstrating its potential value as a clinical tool.},

Each study was conducted according to an open, randomized,  single-dose, two-period cross-over design in healthy volunteers with a wash-out  period from 7 to 14 days. Blood samples were taken up to 72 h in both studies,  the plasma was separated. Concentrations of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide  were determined by HPLC-MS-MS method. In the first study, the 90\% confidence  interval for intra-individual ratios of AUC0-t and Cmax of lisinopril were  between 0.85 and 1.12 (AUC0-t) and between 0.87 and 1.17 (Cmax), and thus within  the acceptance ranges. In the second study, i.e. after administration of combined  lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide formulations, the 90\% confidence interval for  intra-individual ratios of AUC0-inf and Cmax of lisinopril were between 0.83 and  1.22 (AUC0-inf) and between 0.80 and 1.25 (Cmax). The 90\% confidence interval for  intra-individual ratios of AUC0-inf and Cmax of hydrochlorothiazide were between  0.92 and 1.04 (AUC0-inf) and between 0.88 and 1.08 (Cmax). All the above values  were within the acceptance ranges for bioequivalence studies. In the light of the  present studies it can be concluded that Hsinopril as well as  lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide test formulations are bioequivalent to the  respective reference formulations.},

The cumulative urinary excretion and the  renal HCT clearance were correspondingly reduced in patients with impaired kidney  function. In normal subjects HCT was mainly excreted by tubular secretion, but as  renal HCT clearance in patients with renal impairment did not differ  significantly from endogenous creatinine clearance, it was concluded that the  secretory mechanism is most markedly impaired. In patients with an endogenous  creatinine clearance of 30 to 90 ml/min, the dosage of HCT should be reduced to  1/2 and in patients with a endogenous creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min to 1/4  of the normal daily dose to avoid dose dependant side-effects.},

This study examined the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic,  and neurohumoral effects of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) administration in a  matched group of 9 black and 9 white hypertensive patients (mean +/- SD for black  and white). After a 4-week washout period and 7-day control diet, subjects  received a single dose of HCTZ (25 mg at 8 AM) with serial blood and urine  collections for 36 hours. After HCTZ sodium excretion increased comparably in  both groups (blacks: 122 +/- 42 pre to 265 +/- 49 mEq/24 hours post; whites: 117  +/- 29 pre to 255 beta 39 mEq/24 hrs post). Potassium excretion tended to be  higher at baseline and was significantly higher following HCTZ in whites (blacks:  45 beta 20 pre to 66 beta 13 mEq at 24 hours post; blacks: 57 +/- 9 pre to 86 +/-  14 mEq at 24 hours post) with most of the post-dosing difference being observed  in the hours 0 to 12 after HCTZ. There were no between group PK differences for  urinary HCTZ. Aldosterone excretion followed a normal circadian pattern in the  whites but did not show this pattern in the blacks. Aldosterone excretion (0 to  12 hours) was generally lower post-dosing in blacks. In conclusion, whereas the  PK and single-dose natriuretic response for HCTZ were not racially distinct,  potassium excretion was notably less in blacks. Aldosterone excretion was also  lower in blacks and without its normal circadian pattern which may, in part,  explain their altered potassium excretion pattern.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: This article presents libRoadRunner, an extensible, high-performance, cross-platform, open-source software library for the simulation and analysis of models expressed using Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). SBML is the most widely used standard for representing dynamic networks, especially biochemical networks. libRoadRunner is fast enough to support large-scale problems such as tissue models, studies that require large numbers of repeated runs and interactive simulations.             Results: libRoadRunner is a self-contained library, able to run both as a component inside other tools via its C++ and C bindings, and interactively through its Python interface. Its Python Application Programming Interface (API) is similar to the APIs of MATLAB (www.mathworks.com) and SciPy (http://www.scipy.org/), making it fast and easy to learn. libRoadRunner uses a custom Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler built on the widely used LLVM JIT compiler framework. It compiles SBML-specified models directly into native machine code for a variety of processors, making it appropriate for solving extremely large models or repeated runs. libRoadRunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of the SBML specification (except for delay and non-linear algebraic equations) including several SBML extensions (composition and distributions). It offers multiple deterministic and stochastic integrators, as well as tools for steady-state analysis, stability analysis and structural analysis of the stoichiometric matrix.             Availability and implementation: libRoadRunner binary distributions are available for Mac OS X, Linux and Windows. The library is licensed under Apache License Version 2.0. libRoadRunner is also available for ARM-based computers such as the Raspberry Pi. http://www.libroadrunner.org provides online documentation, full build instructions, binaries and a git source repository.

  abstract = {Aliskiren is a novel, orally active direct renin inhibitor that lowers blood pressure alone and in combination with existing antihypertensive agents. As  aliskiren does not affect cytochrome P450 enzyme activities, is minimally  metabolised, and is not extensively protein bound, the potential for drug  interactions is predicted to be low. Four open-label studies investigated the  pharmacokinetic interactions between aliskiren 300 mg and the antihypertensive  drugs amlodipine 10 mg (n = 18), valsartan 320 mg (n = 18), hydrochlorothiazide  25 mg (HCTZ, n = 22) and ramipril 10 mg (n = 17) in healthy subjects. In each  study, subjects received multiple once-daily doses of aliskiren and the test  antihypertensive drug alone or in combination in two dosing periods separated by  a drug-free washout period. Plasma concentrations of drugs were determined by  liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry methods. At steady state, relatively  small changes in exposure to aliskiren were observed when aliskiren was  co-administered with amlodipine (AUC(tau) increased by 29\%, p = 0.032), ramipril  (C(max,ss) increased by 31\%, p = 0.043), valsartan (AUC(tau) decreased by 26\%, p  = 0.002) and HCTZ (C(max,ss) decreased by 22\%, p = 0.039). Co-administration with  aliskiren resulted in small changes in exposure to ramipril (AUC(tau) increased  by 22\%, p = 0.002), valsartan (AUC(tau) decreased by 14\%, p = 0.062) and HCTZ  (AUC(tau) decreased by 10\% and C(max,ss) by 26\%, both p {$<$} 0.001). All other  changes in pharmacokinetic parameters were also small, and not statistically  significant. None of the observed pharmacokinetic changes was considered  clinically relevant. Aliskiren inhibited plasma renin activity (PRA) and also  prevented the reactive rise in PRA induced by valsartan. The most commonly  reported adverse events were headache, dizziness and gastrointestinal symptoms  (all mild in severity), which were similar in frequency during antihypertensive  drug treatment alone and in combination with aliskiren except for an increase in  dizziness during treatment with the combination of aliskiren and HCTZ. In  conclusion, aliskiren shows no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions  and is generally well tolerated when administered in combination with amlodipine,  valsartan, HCTZ or ramipril.},

  abstract = {Diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide are widely used to treat cardiovascular disease, often in combination. The purpose of this investigation was to determine  whether a drug-drug pharmacokinetic interaction exists between diltiazem and  hydrochlorothiazide. In a randomized, crossover, open study, multiple doses of  diltiazem (60 mg four times daily for 21 doses) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg  twice daily for 11 doses) were administered alone and in combination on three  separate occasions to 20 healthy male volunteers. Trough and serial blood samples  were collected and plasma was assayed for diltiazem, hydrochlorothiazide, and  diltiazem metabolites (desacetyldiltiazem and N-desmethyldiltiazem) using HPLC.  Total urine was also collected and quantified for hydrochlorothiazide.  Coadministered hydrochlorothiazide did not significantly (p {$>$} 0.05) alter  diltiazem (alone versus combination) steady-state maximum plasma concentration  (Css(max); 145 versus 158 ng mL(-1), respectively), time to maximum plasma  concentration (t(max); 3.0 versus 2.8 h, respectively); area under the plasma  concentration-time curve (AUCss; 688 versus 771 ng x h mL(-1)), oral clearance  (Cl(oral); 96.2 versus 88.0 L h(-1)), or elimination half-life (t(1/2); 5.2  versus 5.2 h). Similarly, administration of diltiazem did not significantly (p {$>$}  0.05) influence hydrochlorothiazide (alone versus combination) Css(max) (221  versus 288 ng mL(-1)), t(max) (1.8 versus 2.0 h), AUCss (1194 versus 1247 ng x h  mL(-1)), Cl(oral) (22.4 versus 21.2 L h(-1)); t(1/2) (9.8 versus 9.6 h), or renal  Cl (15.5 versus 15.2 L h(-1)). In conclusion, a clinically significant  pharmacokinetic interaction between diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide does not  exist.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               This article presents libRoadRunner 2.0, an extensible, high-performance, cross-platform, open-source software library for the simulation and analysis of models expressed using the systems biology markup language (SBML).                                         Results               libRoadRunner is a self-contained library, able to run either as a component inside other tools via its C++, C and Python APIs, or interactively through its Python or Julia interface. libRoadRunner uses a custom just-in-time (JIT) compiler built on the widely used LLVM JIT compiler framework. It compiles SBML-specified models directly into native machine code for a large variety of processors, making it fast enough to simulate extremely large models or repeated runs in reasonable timeframes. libRoadRunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of the SBML specification (except for delay and non-linear algebraic equations) as well as several SBML extensions such as hierarchical composition and probability distributions. It offers multiple deterministic and stochastic integrators, as well as tools for steady-state, sensitivity, stability and structural analyses.                                         Availability and implementation               libRoadRunner binary distributions for Windows, Mac OS and Linux, Julia and Python bindings, source code and documentation are all available at https://github.com/sys-bio/roadrunner, and Python bindings are also available via pip. The source code can be compiled for the supported systems as well as in principle any system supported by LLVM-13, such as ARM-based computers like the Raspberry Pi.

  abstract = {It is known that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as indomethacin can attenuate the pharmacologic effect of loop diuretics such as furosemide and  ethacrynic acid and that indomethacin may also reduce the pharmacologic response  to chlorothiazide. To examine further this potential drug-drug interaction, we  administered 50- an 100-mg single oral doses of hydrochlorothiazide with and  without indomethacin to 10 healthy, normal subjects. We observed no significant  influence of indomethacin to 10 healthy, normal subjects. We observed no  significant influence of indomethacin either on the pharmacokinetics of  hydrochlorothiazide or the pharmacologic response to this diuretic. The  adsorption and disposition of hydrochlorothiazide demonstrate that this drug is  rapidly absorbed and produces a diuretic and natriuretic response that peaks at  approximately 2 hours after dosing and is essentially terminated 12 hours after  dosing. There appeared to be no greater pharmacologic response to the 100-mg than  to the 50-mg hydrochlorothiazide dose in the ten subjects in this study.},
