Postoperative  weight loss averaged 53.4kg. The concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide in plasma  and urine were determined with gas/liquid chromatography. The mean area under the  plasma concentration time curve during 9h in 4 of the patients was 889ng/ml.h.  Mean total urinary recovery of hydrochlorothiazide amounted to 23.0mg in the 5  patients, which corresponds to approximately half that seen in healthy  volunteers.

  abstract = {The bioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide from 50-mg oral tablet doses was examined in healthy male volunteers under fasting and nonfasting conditions.  Bioavailability was examined from plasma levels and urinary excretion of  unchanged drug. The pharmacokinetics of hydrochlorothiazide in plasma could be  described in terms of a triexponential function, and the mean drug half-lives  determined from the three exponents were 1.0, 2.2, and 9.0 hr. Changing the  accompanying fluid volume has no significant effect on hydrochlorothiazide  absorption in fasted subjects. Plasma drug levels were significantly reduced in  non-fasted individuals, compared with those in fasted individuals. A similar  trend was observed in the urinary excretion of hydrochlorothiazide, but  differences between treatments were not significant (p greater than 0.05). Mean  48-hr urinary recovery of hydrochlorothiazide was 70.5\% of the dose in nonfasted  subjects, and 73.5 and 75.0\% of the dose in fasted subjects receiving the drug  with 20 and 250 ml of water, respectively. The cumulative urinary excretion of  hydrochlorothiazide correlated poorly (r = 0.27) with areas under plasma drug  level curves, although the correlation between the means of these values for each  of the three treatments was high (r = 0.996).. Close similarity was observed  between urinary excretion rates of hydrochlorothiazide and the time course of  drug concentrations in plasma.},

The gastrointestinal absorption ranged between 60\% and 80\%,  most of it took place in the duodenum and the upper jejunum. The radioactivity  was eliminated mainly in the urine, while no sigificant biliary excretion was  observed. Chromatographic analysis of the urinary radioactivity demonstrated that  greater than 95\% of the absorbed or injected 14C-hct was excreted unchanged. The  radioactivity in plasma during the first 10 hr after oral administration declined  with a fast phase but the levels of label thereafter suggested a slow phase. The  existence of such a phase was verified in 1 subject given 75 mg hct orally. His  plasma levels of hct (determined with gas-liquid chromatography) declined  according to a 2-compartment model, the half-lives of the alpha-and beta-phases  being 1.7 and 13.1 hr, respectively. Hct accumulated in the blood cells and the  ratio between the radioactivity in cells and that in plasma averaged 3.5. The  fate of a single dose of 14C-hct in 2 hypertensive patients treated with the drug  chronically was similar to that in the healthy subjects. A third patient, who had  slightly elevated serum creatinine, eliminated hct more slowly than the others.  Like the healthy subjects, the patients eliminated hct to greater than 95\% in  unchanged form.},

  abstract = {Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a thiazide diuretic used in adults and children for the treatment of hypertension and edema. The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of  HCTZ in children are not well characterized, particularly among children with  obesity who frequently suffer from hypertension and may, therefore, benefit from  HCTZ therapy. HCTZ is excreted in the kidney via organic anion transporters 1 and  3 (OAT1 and OAT3). The ontogeny of OAT1 and OAT3 remain unknown, but HCTZ  clearance may serve as a surrogate marker of OAT1 and OAT3 maturation. Population  PK modeling was performed in NONMEM, and the model was leveraged to conduct  dose-exposure simulations. This study examined 83 plasma samples from 49  participants (69\% male) taking enteral HCTZ. The median (range) postnatal age was  6.7 years (0.03-19.5 years), and 17 (34\%) participants were obese or morbidly  obese. The median (range) dose of HCTZ was 0.654 mg/kg (0.11-1.8 kg) and the  median number of doses recorded per participant was 5 (1-8). HCTZ PK was well  characterized by a 1-compartment PK model. Body weight and a maturation model  based on postmenstrual age were significant covariates for apparent clearance,  but the presence of obesity was not. Dosing simulations were performed with a  standardized 1mg/kg. Simulated exposure (area under the curve and maximum HCTZ  concentrations) decreased with age and was likely due to older children receiving  the maximum absolute doses of HCTZ. Further studies with more patients in each  age group are required to confirm these PK findings of HCTZ in the children.},

PK-DB provides curated information on (i) characteristics of studied patient cohorts and subjects (e.g. age, bodyweight, smoking status, genetic variants); (ii) applied interventions (e.g. dosing, substance, route of application); (iii) pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g. clearance, half-life, area under the curve)~and (iv) measured pharmacokinetic time-courses. Key features are the representation of experimental errors, the normalization of measurement units, annotation of information to biological ontologies, calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters from concentration-time profiles, a workflow for collaborative data curation, strong validation rules on the data, computational access via a REST API as well as human access via a web interface. PK-DB enables meta-analysis based on data from multiple studies and data integration with computational models. A special focus lies on meta-data relevant for individualized and stratified computational modeling with methods like physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK), pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD), or population pharmacokinetic (pop PK) modeling.},

A community of modelers and software authors developed SBML Level 3 over the past decade. Its modular form consists of a core suited to representing reaction-based models and packages that extend the core with features suited to other model types including constraint-based models, reaction-diffusion models, logical network models, and rule-based models. The format leverages two decades of SBML and a rich software ecosystem that transformed how systems biologists build and interact with models. More recently, the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and organs, and new data sources such as single-cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated new ways of integrating data with models. We provide our perspectives on the challenges presented by these developments and how SBML Level 3 provides the foundation needed to support this evolution.},

  abstract = {Accurate evaluation of liver function is a central task in hepatology. Dynamic liver function tests (DLFT) based on the time-dependent elimination of a test substance provide an important tool for such a functional assessment. These tests are used in the diagnosis and monitoring of liver disease as well as in the planning of hepatobiliary surgery. A key challenge in the evaluation of liver function with DLFTs is the large inter-individual variability. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a widely applied test compound used for the evaluation of liver function. After an intravenous administration, pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters are calculated from the plasma disappearance curve of ICG which provide an estimate of liver function. The hepatic elimination of ICG is affected by physiological factors such as hepatic blood flow or binding of ICG to plasma proteins, anthropometric factors such as body weight, age, and sex, or the protein amount of the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3) mediating the hepatic uptake of ICG. Being able to account for and better understand these various sources of inter-individual variability would allow to improve the power of ICG based DLFTs and move toward an individualized evaluation of liver function. Within this work we systematically analyzed the effect of various factors on ICG elimination by the means of computational modeling. For the analysis, a recently developed and validated physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) model of ICG distribution and hepatic elimination was utilized. Key results are (i) a systematic analysis of the variability in ICG elimination due to hepatic blood flow, cardiac output, OATP1B3 abundance, liver volume, body weight and plasma bilirubin level; (ii) the evaluation of the inter-individual variability in ICG elimination via a large               in silico               cohort of               n               = 100,000 subjects based on the NHANES cohort with special focus on stratification by age, sex, and body weight; (iii) the evaluation of the effect of various degrees of cirrhosis on variability in ICG elimination. The presented results are an important step toward individualizing liver function tests by elucidating the effects of confounding physiological and anthropometric parameters in the evaluation of liver function via ICG.},

Indocyanine green (ICG) is a widely applied test compound that is used in clinical routine to evaluate hepatic function. Important questions for the functional evaluation with ICG in the context of hepatectomy are how liver disease such as cirrhosis alters ICG elimination, and if postoperative survival can be predicted from preoperative ICG measurements. Within this work a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of ICG was developed and applied to the prediction of the effects of a liver resection under various degrees of cirrhosis. For the parametrization of the computational model and validation of model predictions a database of ICG pharmacokinetic data was established. The model was applied (i) to study the effect of liver cirrhosis and liver resection on ICG pharmacokinetics; and (ii) to evaluate the model-based prediction of postoperative ICG-R15 (retention ratio 15 min after administration) as a measure for postoperative outcome. Key results are the accurate prediction of changes in ICG pharmacokinetics caused by liver cirrhosis and postoperative changes of ICG-elimination after liver resection, as validated with a wide range of data sets. Based on the PBPK model, individual survival after liver resection could be classified, demonstrating its potential value as a clinical tool.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: This article presents libRoadRunner, an extensible, high-performance, cross-platform, open-source software library for the simulation and analysis of models expressed using Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). SBML is the most widely used standard for representing dynamic networks, especially biochemical networks. libRoadRunner is fast enough to support large-scale problems such as tissue models, studies that require large numbers of repeated runs and interactive simulations.             Results: libRoadRunner is a self-contained library, able to run both as a component inside other tools via its C++ and C bindings, and interactively through its Python interface. Its Python Application Programming Interface (API) is similar to the APIs of MATLAB (www.mathworks.com) and SciPy (http://www.scipy.org/), making it fast and easy to learn. libRoadRunner uses a custom Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler built on the widely used LLVM JIT compiler framework. It compiles SBML-specified models directly into native machine code for a variety of processors, making it appropriate for solving extremely large models or repeated runs. libRoadRunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of the SBML specification (except for delay and non-linear algebraic equations) including several SBML extensions (composition and distributions). It offers multiple deterministic and stochastic integrators, as well as tools for steady-state analysis, stability analysis and structural analysis of the stoichiometric matrix.             Availability and implementation: libRoadRunner binary distributions are available for Mac OS X, Linux and Windows. The library is licensed under Apache License Version 2.0. libRoadRunner is also available for ARM-based computers such as the Raspberry Pi. http://www.libroadrunner.org provides online documentation, full build instructions, binaries and a git source repository.
