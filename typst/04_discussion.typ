Modeled impairment effects: 

*Cardiac* (↓ GI-tract perfusion ↓ absorption)
We dont think cardiac impairment affects absorption because...
in Beerman1976 they all have cardiac failure, SP has normal renal function. But SP has normal urinary recovery, regardless of cardiac failure. So its not showing cardiac failure = lower absorption. Data is showing renal impairment = decreased total urinary recovery which does not make sense

*Renal* (↓ metabolite clearance)

*Hepatic* (effect vs no effect hepatorenal syndrome)

Despite minimal metabolization of hydrochlorothiazide by the liver our data revealed a decrease in peak plasma concentration and urinary excretion in subjects with hepatic impairment. These findings suggest that hepatic dysfunction can indirectly alter hydrochlorothiazide pharmacokinetics through mechanisms beyond metabolism. In advanced liver disease reduced hepatic function is often accompanied by cirrhosis and systemic hemodynamic changes such as decreased effective arterial blood volume splanchnic vasodilation and secondary renal hypoperfusion that characterize hepatorenal syndrome. These pathophysiological alterations can impair renal clearance and reduce drug delivery to the kidneys thereby diminishing both systemic exposure and urinary recovery. Furthermore hypoalbuminemia associated with cirrhosis may modify the drug's plasma protein binding and distribution. Such effects may warrant caution when dosing in patients with advanced cirrhosis.

Careful monitoring of therapeutic response and volume status is needed in patients with cardiac/renal/hepatic impairment receiving hydrochlorothiazide.

== Limitations of Model


== Limitations of Data

 One study (Beermann1976) exhibited values inconsistent with physiologically plausible concentration ranges and deviated substantially from all other clinical datasets. Despite extensive review the discrepancy could not be reconciled and likely reflects a unit or reporting error in the original source. Accordingly this outlier dataset was excluded from model calibration and evaluation.
